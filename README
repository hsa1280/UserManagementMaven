http://localhost:8080/app.html

The problems I faced:
1. When using spring-boot, there is no need to create a web.xml
2. Place the application.properties under resources folder directly, so @value can find the values
3. Hibernate field 'id' doesn't have a default value, we need to add AUTO_INCREMENT for the id field when creating a table.
4. If we use normal web.xml to config our app, then the project path will be: localhost:8080/projectName/<url-pattern>/html file, this rule also applies to any api call, one example is
$http.get('/UserManagement/page/data')
5. If we use spring-boot, there is no web.xml and WebApplicationConfig to define the viewResolver, so the project path will be: localhost:8080/html file, this rule also applies to any api call; we can
add a path parameter to the project path by adding it in the server: contextPath: /UserManagementMaven, which is in resources/config/application.yml
